## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
=======
<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

# boots.lmer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of boots.lmer is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of boots.lmer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UofUEpiBio/PHS7045-midterm")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(boots.lmer)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
>>>>>>> e5c145b995dbfb05056647d87530fd11503a7050:README.Rmd

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

<<<<<<< HEAD:boots.lmer/README.Rmd
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
=======
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
