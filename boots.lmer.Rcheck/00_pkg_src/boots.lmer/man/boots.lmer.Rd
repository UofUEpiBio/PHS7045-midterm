\title{Bootstrap Sampled Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMERs)}
\usage{
boots.lmer(y, X, boots.samples.list, use.formula = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{character string. Name of column in each data.table of boots.samples.list, to be used as the outcome in LMER.}

\item{X}{a vector of character string.  Names of the of covariates to fit in LMER, as they appear on each dataset of boots.samples.list.}

\item{boots.samples.list}{boots.samples output.}

\item{use.formula}{a vector of class formula. This is to be used in lmer fit. If not provided, then a basic additive fixed effects model with random effect of (1|no.repeat.sub.id) will be fit.}
}
\value{
A list of length B, of linear mixed effects model fits.
